## Personal Projects
- [Road Tracking and Sign Recognition with a Reduced-Scale Vehicle Using Deep Learning Technique](https://github.com/ismael-dm/TFG): A Deep Learning project carried out as Bachelor Thesis. The objective was to develop a reduced scale vehicle capable of driving autonomously, recognizing traffic signs and following the road, using technologies like Keras, OpenCV, Python and different types of neural networks.
